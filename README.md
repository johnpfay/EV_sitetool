# EV Siting Tool

This tool presents a workflow for creating an optimized EV charging network across North Carolina. Optimization is based on the following factors: 

* Reducing "range anxiety" by creating a constellation of charging locations that enable electric cars maximal coverage across the state. 
* Favoring charging locations that offer amenities such as restaurants, cafes, entertainment.
* Minimizing costs by reducing redundant sites, minimizing up-front infrastructure needs, and avoiding hazards. 



## Range Anxiety

* Identify areas along NC highways **<u>not</u>** served by DCFC charging locations. These are areas where we want to focus in placing new sites.
